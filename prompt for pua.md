can you create a custom compose key setup (GNOME linux) for the first 63 pua unicode areas, based on my conlang with the following rules.

6 versions of each vowel, 9 vowels, 9 consonants (no consonant variations), plus 2 at the very end for punctuation,

it goes v1 = {letters} or {letters}1, v2 = {letters}1`, v3 = {letters}2, v4 = {letters}2`, v5 = {letters}3, v6 = {letters}3` (the tilde mark is for the diacritic)

the consonants will just be the {letters}

the punctuation is ? for the first one and ?? for the second one

this is the letter list in order

(vowels)

ah, yi, ng, eu, de, kae, u, ma, zhi, sta

(consonants)

ts, l, n, s, b, t, r, rd, h
