Natives on Kaesmasyi now have a large group of around 50 individuals.
One person declares divine right from the sea around the island, others follow him. This individual appoints two others, considered the wisest in the group, to create standardized writing.

Context:
	Natives previously used cave paintings as a writing system, drawing out scenes to hold information and convey meaning. A very simple spoken system was already long in use.

(English Approximations)
The word for rock was "aats / ahts", leading the scholar ([[Kaema-ahzu]]) to use a generic rock image with jagged lines to represent the sound "ahts". Similarly, he used this method with the word for person, drawing a face becoming the sound "kai"(modern romanization is "kae").

Here are all of the early sounds of the Kaesmasyi alphabet.

| Cave Drawing / Word | Modern Approximation                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Rock - Ahts         | ahts (later breaks into the sounds ah & ts)        |
| Person - Kai        | kai (turns into kae over time)                     |
| Animal - Eur        | eu (eur is still a accent in modern)               |
| Location - Yi       | yi (becomes the root word for time and place)<br>  |
| Food - Nga          | ng / nga (becomes the consonant version in modern) |
These sounds were used for a phonetic alphabet, which made up many independent words that typically had little relation to each other early on.

Many old words have been lost, but the roots still show up in modern words, like with "eur" (animal) becoming the modern negation word "eu", and kai (person) becoming kae, the modern I pronoun and a root word for many person and societal based words. A combination of these roots is present in the word for "thing", eu-rd-kae (lit. not person).
